# Cushon ISA Investment Test

## Cloning and Installing Deps

```sh
git clone git@github.com:hendore/cushon-test.git
cd cushon-test
npm install
```

## Running

The application uses vite to launch a dev server and build production releases. To launch
the dev server just run `npm run start`.

## Tests

I've added a few `uvu` tests around the logic of the application (reducers). To run the
tests you can use the npm alias/script `npm run test`.
